RFC README
----------

the RFC must be written using roff with a subset of the ms macros and
using the IETF-supplied perl script fix.pl to adjust things to the way
they like them.

so, there's a stack of component files, compiled together using m4.
i've avoided multi-level inclusion to avoid the need for makedepend
(which i don't know exists for m4?)


the overall structure is (for now)
