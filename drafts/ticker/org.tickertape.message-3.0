Message-Id
string

Globally unique identifier for this message.  We recommend the use of
a UUID (or GUID), optionally hashed (using SHA.1, MD5, etc) to ensure
anonymity (since the UUID includes the MAC address of the generating
machine).
%%
In-Reply-To
string
O
The Message-Id of a previous message to which this is a reply.
%%
Thread-Id
string
O
When sending a message to a group to which the sender is not
subscribed, but wishes to see any replies, this field should be set
(and the sender's user agent should alter its subscription so as to
receive any messages with this Thread-Id value).

User agents, receiving a message with a Thread-Id set, should copy the
supplied value into any replies.

This value must be globally unique.  See Message-Id for
recommendations.
%%

%%
User-Agent

The name and version of the user agent generating this message.
%%

If this message should not be archived, this field should be present,
and the value should be non-zero.
%%
Distribution
string
O
A value, intended for interpretation by forwarding filters at
administrative boundaries, describing restrictions on the distribution
of this message.

No constraints are set on the value of this field, but examples might
include "local", "company_name", etc.
%%
Attachment
opaque
O
A MIME-encoded addition to the message.  multiple objects should be
encoded using the multipart/mixed MIME type.

Note that this field is an opaque type, and thus an array of bytes.
therefore, it is not necessary to encode attachments (using, for
example, base64) as is the usual practice for email.
