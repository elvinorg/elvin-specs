RFC README
----------

the RFC must be written using roff with a subset of the ms macros and
using the IETF-supplied perl script fix.pl to adjust things to the way
they like them.

so, there's a stack of component files, compiled together using m4.
i've avoided multi-level inclusion to avoid the need for makedepend
(which i don't know exists for m4?)

a detailed structure can be generated by:

  make outline

which will create outline.txt.

When adding/modifying the document, keep in mind the following:

* main.m4 should only need modification for MAJOR structual
  changs, eg section reordering.

* main.m4 should include only top level sections, ie m4_heading(1, ...)

* each M4 file apart from ushould start on a section boundary and should have the
  appropriate m4_heading() command as the first non-comment line
